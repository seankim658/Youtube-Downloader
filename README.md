# Youtube Video and Audio Downloader  

Simple Python Tkinter application to download video and audio from Youtube. Youtube supports Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP, or DASH. Due to this, the highest quality downloads have to download the audio and video files separately. This application automatically downloads the highest resolution video stream available and the best available audio stream of the same file format as the video. Combining the video and audio must be done in preprocessing. Will potentially add that to the application in the future. 

## Running 

Python and Pytube are needed. Run from `main.py`.
